With the increasing demand for intelligent transformation in the hotel industry, designing an efficient and reliable control system for service robots has become crucial to optimizing service experiences. This paper addresses the needs of item delivery and autonomous navigation in hotel scenarios by designing a control system for a service robot based on two-wheel differential drive, aiming to achieve functions such as autonomous navigation, intelligent obstacle avoidance, task execution, and remote monitoring. 
The hardware system adopts a dual-control-board architecture of ESP32-S3 and ESP32-CAM, constructing a multi-sensor perception system that includes an infrared tracing module, an RFID positioning module, and an ultrasonic obstacle avoidance module. It integrates the AT8236 motor driver module with orthogonal encoders to achieve precise motion control and completes multi-level voltage conversion through the LM2596S power module.
At the software level, based on the FreeRTOS real-time operating system, an infrared tracing algorithm, an RFID navigation and positioning algorithm, and an ultrasonic dynamic obstacle avoidance strategy are developed. The PID algorithm is used to implement closed-loop motor control, while the Blinker platform is integrated to enable remote status monitoring and command interaction. Through state machine design, the system supports switching between automatic and manual modes and establishes safety protection mechanisms for battery management and fault diagnosis. 
Test results show that the system achieves a high room recognition accuracy in simulated hotel environments, controls the lateral offset of tracing within allowable limits, ensures remote video transmission delay meets control requirements, and operates continuously for a long time. This design, through modular structure and multi-sensor fusion, effectively enhances the robotâ€™s adaptability and reliability in structured environments, providing a reusable technical solution for the engineering application of hotel service robots.
